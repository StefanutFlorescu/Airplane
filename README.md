# 3D Airplane Model

## Description

This project contains a detailed 3D model of an airplane created using AutoCAD. The model captures the essential features of an aircraft, including the wings, fuselage, cockpit, tail, and landing gear. It can be used for visualization, animation, or as a base model for more advanced modifications in other 3D design software.

## Features

- **Accurate Geometry**: The model includes precise dimensions of an airplane's major components.
- **Fully Rendered**: The object is designed for 3D viewing and can be rendered in AutoCAD or other 3D software.
- **Editable Design**: Easily modify the model to fit different aircraft designs or export it for further customization.
- **Layered Structure**: Organized with layers for different components, such as the wings, fuselage, and landing gear.

## Requirements

- **AutoCAD**: You will need AutoCAD (or any compatible CAD software) to open, view, and modify the file.
- **Supported File Formats**: 
  - `.dwg` for AutoCAD
